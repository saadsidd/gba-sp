# Game Boy Advance SP Customizer
### [Try it out here!](https://www.saad.gg/gba-sp)

Hit by a wave of nostalgia, I modeled a Game Boy Advance SP handheld console in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and turned it into a website for people to customize its colors. The model is displayed using [Three.js]((https://threejs.org/)), animated with [Tween.js](https://createjs.com/tweenjs), and uses [dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui) for picking colors.

The user can rotate, zoom, and pan the camera with the mouse.

The base, screen, buttons, and text are all customizable either separately or all together. The power button at the top also "turns on" the console by moving the power switch, changing the power light, and playing a startup screen animation.
